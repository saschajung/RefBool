The pre-computed reference distributions for human microarray (Affymetrix HG-U133Plus2)
were extracted from [1] and for human RNA-Seq from [2]. Threshold distributions were obtained based on the best fitting distribution as described in the RefBool paper[3]. 

Data Access:
The pre-processed RNA-Seq data from [1] is available at
https://webdav-r3lab.uni.lu/public/cbg/RefBool_ReferenceDistributions/

for linux/unix systems you can use e.g.:
$wget -r -nH --cut-dirs=2 --no-parent https://webdav-r3lab.uni.lu/public/cbg/RefBool_ReferenceDistributions/

In this pre-processed dataset counts are in transcript per millon (TPM) form.

More data will be available soon!
